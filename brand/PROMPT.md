Name this Claude chat: Longtail Travel (Thailand)

Build a travel website for Thailand in this repo, from scratch.

Brand:
- Longtail Travel (the longtail boats of Thailand's rivers, canals and Andaman coast)

Positioning: Thailand by water and by season: Bangkok's canals, the north's hills and the right coast for the month, beyond the crowded routes.

Pages: home, Bangkok, Ayutthaya, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and the Golden Triangle, Mae Hong Son, Sukhothai, Khao Sok, Krabi and Koh Yao Noi, Koh Lanta, Koh Samui and Koh Phangan, Koh Kood, sample journeys, stays (placeholder names), about, journal, enquiry form.

Signature features:
1. A two-coasts picker: choose your month and it shows whether the Andaman or the Gulf coast has the better weather, with island picks for each.
2. A Bangkok khlong map: the canals by longtail boat, with routes and stops drawn as a living water map.
3. A responsible elephant and hill-tribe page: how to choose ethical sanctuaries and visit villages respectfully.

References and layout:
Primary references for this site: aman.com, affable-wealth-322227.framer.app, vita-travel.webflow.io.
Copy the design of the primary references exactly: page structure, section order, layout grids, navigation and menus, hero treatment, image sizes and crops, type scale, spacing, buttons, hover and scroll animations, and page transitions. Take each part from whichever primary reference does it best, then make the whole site consistent, as if one designer made it, with no mismatched pieces. Open every primary reference (in a browser if you can) and study its home page and inner pages before writing code. When you finish, compare your pages with the references side by side and fix every difference in structure or layout. Use the other sites below only for small extra details.
Layout rules: no centred content. Left-align headings and text. Use full-width layouts where images and sections run edge to edge. Keep side margins small (about 16-24px on mobile and 32-48px on desktop); never put the content in a narrow centred column with wide empty space on the left and right.
Copy the design, not the content: write your own text, use photos as the rules below say, and never use the references' logos, brand names, photos, text or code.
All references: aman.com, belmond.com, sixsenses.com, almahospitality.it, thedrake.ca, safari.com, white-desert.com, elementis.co, flyward.com, thetailor.com, sabbatical.travel, selvora-zeta.vercel.app, vita-travel.webflow.io, stillwild.framer.website, affable-wealth-322227.framer.app, enchanting-impact-453443.framer.app, wonderful-tenets-610450.framer.app, kultiveret.com, mathieu-crepel.com, mountainbikeworldwide.com, localadventure.mammut.com, eaglesnest.sergesyutkin.com, sylverrappresentanze.it.

Theme (sets this brand's colours, typefaces and motifs inside the reference layout; where the theme describes a layout, the primary references win): RIBBON AND RIVER. The coloured ribbons and marigold garlands tied to a longtail's prow are the motif, used as thin flowing lines that lead the eye down each page. Jade river water as background tone. An expressive modern grotesque for headlines and a warm sans for text. The home page follows a longtail boat down a jade river, its ribbons trailing in the wind as you scroll. Palette: river jade, marigold, rice-paper cream, temple red (accent), teak brown. Do NOT use the generic template: no centred hero with headline and two buttons, no row of three rounded feature cards, no Inter or Poppins.

Rules: static site, fast and mobile-first, WCAG AA contrast. Photos: high quality only, and only where the photo's location matches the place it's used for. Unsplash photos carry no credit line on the site; Creative Commons (e.g. Wikimedia) photos are credited on a small credits page. Where the site names a hotel, lodge, restaurant or café, show that real place only with an image you are clearly allowed to use (the venue's media kit or press terms, a booking-platform partner feed, or Creative Commons); never copy images from a venue's own website. If none exists, show a correct photo of the location and list the venue in IMAGES-NEEDED.md. No invented reviews, press logos or awards. Put the brand name, contact details and palette in one config file so the brand can be swapped. List every fact that needs checking (visa-exemption length, the Deep South and Cambodian-border travel advice, monsoon by coast, national park closures) in FACTS-TO-VERIFY.md. Write a README explaining how to run and edit the site.

Owner's rules (these override anything above):
1. Speed first: Lighthouse mobile 90+, LCP under 2.5s, CLS under 0.1, first load under ~1.5 MB. Right-sized images (srcset/sizes, AVIF/WebP), width and height on every image, lazy-load below the fold, hero image preloaded with fetchpriority high, only the font weights used with font-display swap, no render-blocking JS, heavy libraries and video loaded on demand (poster only on mobile), long cache headers for static assets in vercel.json.
2. No phone numbers, no WhatsApp links or buttons, no licence information, no team section, no social media links, no testimonials or reviews.
3. Complete Privacy Policy, Booking Terms and Cookie Policy pages with the brand name, email and address below, no placeholders, all linked in the footer.
4. No "Photographs from Unsplash" or other Unsplash credit text.
5. The only email address is longtailtravel@tourground.com; the site URL format is longtailtravel.tourground.com.
6. Images of named hotels, restaurants, cafés and places follow the photo rules above.
7. Every price reads "From (amount)"; never invent prices.
8. Business address: the most premium coworking space in Thailand (flagship space in the capital or main business city); research it and use its exact street address in the config, footer, contact page, legal pages and JSON-LD.
9. Four languages: English (default), French, German, Spanish. Every page in all four (English at the root, /fr/, /de/, /es/), all copy translated naturally including nav, forms, legal pages, meta and alt text; a keyboard-accessible EN · FR · DE · ES selector in the header and mobile menu that links to the same page in the other language; correct html lang, hreflang (x-default English) and canonical; every locale pre-rendered with no translation library in the browser; no automatic redirect by browser language.

When you're done, host it on Vercel: make sure the build command works, add a vercel.json (build command, output folder, clean URLs), push everything to main on GitHub (benjamingjoel2/thailand), import the repo into Vercel under the team "Benjamin - Sevo" and deploy it. Then open the live URL, check every page and the enquiry form there, and put the live URL in the config file and the README.
